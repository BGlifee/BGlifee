## Hi there 👋

I'm Hisu - a data enthusiast who loves building predictive models that make sense in the real world.

I enjoy bridging the technical and human sides of data: turning complex results into insights people actually understand and use.

My main stack is Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, and I care a lot about clean pipelines,
reproducibility, and interpretability.

I've built several ML projects, but **my favorites** are:

- Telco Churn Model – end-to-end pipeline + ROI insights
- Wine Quality Prediction – model comparison + real understanding
- Molecular Melting-Point Prediction – scalable scientific ML project (Top 30% Kaggle 🏅)

If you like clarity, collaboration, and thoughtful engineering, you’ll enjoy my work 😊

**Fun Facts**

- I love learning new tools and improving workflows
- Currently exploring SQL, FastAPI & MLOps
- Coffee + coding = perfect day ☕️💻
